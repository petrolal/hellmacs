;; Small macros and helpers every other Hellmacs file (core and

;; down to what Hellmacs actually needs.
;;
;; Naming: the `!'-suffixed macros (`after!', `add-hook!', ...) are
;; user-facing sugar and keep Doom's unprefixed names so config reads
;; the same as in Doom. Everything else is `hellmacs-' prefixed.
;;
;; This file must not depend on any third-party package: it is loaded
;; before the package manager is bootstrapped.
