;; Installing Hellmacs where there is no internet (Phase 12.1).
;;
;; `bin/hellmacs bundle OUT.tar.zst', on a connected machine, syncs, then
;; packs everything that sync installed into one archive:
;;
;;   hellmacs-bundle/manifest.eld       every file below, with its SHA-256
;;   hellmacs-bundle/packages.lock.eld  the exact commit of every package
;;   data/...                           from `hellmacs-data-dir': Elpaca's
;;                                      repositories, builds and recipe
;;                                      caches, the pinned servers and jars,
;;                                      the tree-sitter grammars
;;
;; What goes under data/ is what `hellmacs-bundle-functions' name: core
;; adds Elpaca's packages and the grammars, and each module's cli.el its
;; pinned installs. So a bundle carries what the enabled modules need;
;; `bundle --modules' packs another set.
;;
;; `bin/hellmacs install --from-bundle FILE' unpacks it next to
;; `hellmacs-data-dir', checks every sum, and only then moves it into
;; place. Then it syncs with `hellmacs-net-offline' set, so nothing is
;; fetched: whatever the bundle lacks fails the install, named, rather
;; than reaching for the network.
;;
;; A bundle is for one platform (grammars and clojure-lsp are native code)
;; and one Emacs major version (the packages are byte-compiled); the
;; install refuses any other. Its sums catch a damaged or altered file,
;; but they travel with it: get the bundle itself from a place you trust,
;; and compare its own SHA-256, which `bundle' prints.
