;; Hellmacs uses Elpaca (https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca) rather
;; than straight.el.  Both give reproducible, git-based installs
;; instead of package.el's tarball snapshots, but Elpaca installs
;; packages asynchronously/in parallel, which matters directly for
;; Hellmacs' startup-time goals, and its `elpaca-use-package-mode'
;; integration keeps every module's `use-package' block declarative
;; with no separate recipe step. straight.el remains the better
;; choice if you need its build-caching across machines or its
;; longer track record; Elpaca is the better choice for a
;; startup-performance-first, single-machine distribution, which is
;; Hellmacs' goal.
;;
;; Loaded on demand by `hellmacs-packages-bootstrap', never at a synced
;; startup: Elpaca is only needed to install and build packages.
;;
;; The bootstrap block below is Elpaca's official installer (see its
;; README's "Installer" section), adapted only to redirect Elpaca's
;; own directory into `hellmacs-data-dir' instead of
;; `user-emacs-directory' (the git checkout).
;; Do not hand-edit it piecemeal; replace the whole block from
;; upstream when updating Elpaca's installer version.
