;; `hellmacs-sync' is the equivalent of `doom sync'. Run it (usually as
;; `bin/hellmacs sync') whenever you change your `hellmacs!' block, a
;; packages.el, or a module's autoload.el. It:
;;
;;   1. reads your init.el's `hellmacs!' block and every packages.el
;;   2. installs and builds anything missing, through Elpaca
;;   3. writes a profile (see "Synced profile" in hellmacs-modules.el)
;;      so that startup can activate packages without Elpaca
;;
;; Startup notices when the profile is out of date and falls back to
;; activating packages live, so forgetting to sync slows startup down
;; but never breaks it.
;;
;; Not loaded at startup; `bin/hellmacs' (core/hellmacs-cli.el) and
;; `M-x hellmacs-sync' load it.
