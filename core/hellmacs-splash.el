;; Replaces the GNU splash screen (already off: `inhibit-startup-screen'
;; in early-init.el) with the Altar: a read-only `*hellmacs*' buffer
;; showing the horned cyber-cat sigil, the tagline, and how long startup
;; took.
;;
;; It is shown at startup through `initial-buffer-choice', and in new
;; `emacsclient -c' frames too. `C-c h s' (`hellmacs-splash') returns to
;; it at any time. It's a `special-mode' buffer, so the usual Emacs keys
;; apply: TAB and S-TAB move between the buttons, RET follows one, `g'
;; redraws, `q' buries it. Every global key (`C-x C-f', `C-x b', ...)
;; works as anywhere else.
;;
;; Set `hellmacs-splash-enable' to nil, in your init.el or config.el, to
;; start on *scratch* instead.
