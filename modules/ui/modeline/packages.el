;; doom-modeline requires compat (declared in core/packages.el),
;; nerd-icons (shared with :ui dashboard) and shrink-path, which in turn
;; requires s, dash and f; f requires s and dash too. All declared up
;; front so Elpaca builds each exactly once (see core/packages.el).
(package! s) (package! dash) (package! f)
(package! nerd-icons)
