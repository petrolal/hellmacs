;; A minimal doom-modeline in the Hellmacs palette. The code is
;; modules/ui/hellmacs-modeline.el (the file name the Phase 9 spec gives
;; it); this module puts modules/ui/ on `load-path' and loads it. See
;; that file for the segments and when it turns on.
;;
;; Option, in your init.el or config.el:
;;   (setq hellmacs-modeline-tty-icons t)  ; icons in a terminal with a Nerd Font

;; At compile time too (`bin/hellmacs sync'), for the `require' below.
