;; Git through Magit. Nothing is rebound: Magit binds its own global keys
;; when its autoloads are read (`magit-define-global-key-bindings', which
;; defaults to `default'), so Magit stays unloaded until first use:
;;   C-x g      status of the current repository
;;   C-x M-g    dispatch (init, clone, and commands needing no repository)
;;   C-c M-g    file dispatch (blame, log and diff of the current file)
;; Inside a Magit buffer, `?' lists every command; `C-x g' also works
;; from any buffer in a repository, including Java sources.
;;
;; Magit's transient (the popup menus) keeps its history, levels and
;; saved values in the state directory: see core/hellmacs-core.el.
