;; Debugging through the Debug Adapter Protocol (dap-mode): launch or
;; attach, breakpoints (conditional, log points), stepping, locals,
;; watches and a REPL. Language modules provide the adapter: `:lang
;; java' uses Microsoft's java-debug (dap-java), installed with JDTLS.
;;
;; Owns `C-c d':
;;   d start (pick a template)  D restart the last one
;;   b toggle breakpoint        B condition   L log message   x delete all
;;   n next  i step in  o step out  c continue -- after one of these,
;;     plain n/i/o/c keep stepping (C-c d n n n) until another key
;;   e evaluate at point        E evaluate an expression
;;   r restart session          q disconnect
;;   t debug the test at point  T debug the test class
;; `C-c h r' saves and hot-swaps the changed code into the session.
;;
;; The session windows (sessions, locals, breakpoints, expressions,
;; REPL) open when a session starts. The mouse-driven controls and
;; tooltips stay off: they need a graphical frame and posframe.
