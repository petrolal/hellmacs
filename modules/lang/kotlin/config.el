;; Kotlin, through kotlin-language-server (fwcd's, over lsp-mode). Flags:
;;   +tree-sitter  Use `kotlin-ts-mode' (`bin/hellmacs sync' builds the
;;                 pinned Kotlin grammar)
;;
;; The server is unpacked by `bin/hellmacs sync' (a pinned release, checked
;; by SHA-256) into the data directory. It runs on JAVA_HOME's JDK, like
;; the Gradle build. Completion, navigation, diagnostics, rename and code
;; actions come from `:tools lsp' (`C-c l', `M-.', `C-c ! n'); this module
;; adds `C-c l k' in Kotlin buffers:
;;   b build the project (Gradle, wrapper first)
;;   t run the test at point (with backticked names)    T the test class
;; Both need `:tools build', which also makes compile errors clickable
;; (`e: file:///...Foo.kt:12:5' lines) and shows `[BYTECODE PURGATORY]' when
;; a build fails.
