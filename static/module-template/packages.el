;; What this module installs and needs. Declarations only -- no
;; configuration, no side effects: this file is read before anything is
;; installed. See `package!' for the options (:recipe, :pin, :built-in,
;; :disable). Changes here take effect after `bin/hellmacs sync'.

;; Other modules this one needs; reported if they aren't enabled.

(package! example-package)

;; Only needed with the module's +extra flag:
(when (modulep! +extra)
  (package! example-extra))

;; Tree-sitter grammars (pinned) and the modes they enable; see
;; `hellmacs-treesit!'. Sync builds them, doctor checks them.
