;; SCAFFOLD for a new module. Copy this directory to
;; modules/<group>/<name>/ (or $HELLMACSDIR/modules/<group>/<name>/ for
;; a private one), then enable it in your init.el:
;;
;;   (hellmacs! ... :<group> <name> ...)
;;
;; A module can have any of these files, all optional:
;;   packages.el  `package!' declarations (what to install)
;;   autoload.el  commands/helpers other files may call
;;   init.el      runs before any module's config.el
;;   config.el    this file: the actual configuration
;;
;; Conventions every module follows:
;;
;;   - A comment at the top saying what the module does, which leader
;;     group (if any) it owns, and what its flags do. See
;;     modules/completion/corfu/config.el for a real example.
;;   - Install with `package!' in packages.el; configure with
;;     `use-package' here. Blocks are deferred by default (see
;;     `use-package-always-defer'), so load lazily via
;;     `:hook'/`:bind'/`:commands', or `:demand t' only when genuinely
;;     needed immediately (e.g. `vertico', so the first minibuffer uses
;;     it). Never load a package just by mentioning it.
;;   - Test flags with `(modulep! +flag)'; other modules with
;;     `(modulep! :group name)'.
;;   - Keybindings follow Emacs conventions (see "Keybinding policy"
;;     in docs/roadmap.md): never rebind a default key to something
;;     else. Improve a default command with `[remap ...]' in `:bind',
;;     or add a `C-c' leader binding with `hellmacs-leader-def'.
;;   - Leader groups belong to exactly one module -- the one that owns
;;     that feature. Don't duplicate a binding across modules; layer
;;     onto the owning module's group instead.
