# Work Order & Progress Checklist

> **IMPORTANT**: This is the order in which AI agents pick up roadmap work.
> Take the first unchecked item in the lowest-numbered step, unless the user
> asks for something else. Keep this file current as you work (see the rules
> below).

The order comes from "Sequencing toward the objective" in
[`docs/roadmap.md`](../../roadmap.md). The full spec for each item (scope,
keys, verification, risks) is in the roadmap section named in each heading.
This file only tracks progress. Don't copy specs into it.

---

## Rules for agents

1. **Tick an item only when it's done and verified.** Done means:
   * the roadmap's *Verify* step for it passed;
   * `bin/hellmacs test` and `bin/hellmacs doctor` pass;
   * startup stays under the 0.12s budget if the item touches startup.

   Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` and add the date and a short note, for example
   `- [x] Offline bundle builder (2026-10-02: bundle + install --from-bundle, unit tests)`.
2. **Partial work stays unchecked.** Mark it `- [/]` and say what's left, for
   example `- [/] macOS CI (arm64 job green; x86_64 not added)`.
3. **Keep the roadmap in step.** Tick the matching checkbox in
   `docs/roadmap.md`. When a whole phase or sub-phase is finished, update its
   row in the roadmap's "Phase Summary & Status" table too.
4. **Don't reorder steps on your own.** If the order should change, tell the
   user and suggest editing the roadmap's sequencing table. Then mirror the
   change here.
5. **Found new work?** Add it as an unchecked item under the step it belongs
   to, with a pointer to where it's specified.
