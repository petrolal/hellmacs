# CLI Reference (`bin/hellmacs`)

Hellmacs includes a command-line tool (`bin/hellmacs`) to install, synchronize, upgrade, lock, test, and troubleshoot your installation without launching interactive Emacs.

---

## Commands

### `install`
```sh
bin/hellmacs install [--env] [--no-config] [--from-bundle FILE]
```
Performs initial setup:
* Copies starter templates from `static/` to `~/.config/hellmacs/` (unless `--no-config` is provided or files already exist).
* Executes `sync` to download and compile all packages.
* If `--env` is supplied, exports your shell environment into `~/.local/share/hellmacs/env.eld`.
* Executes `doctor` to ensure everything is operational.
* With `--from-bundle FILE`, installs from an offline bundle (see [`bundle`](#bundle)) with no network access at all:
  * The bundle must be for this platform and Emacs major version, and carry every module (and flag) your config enables. Otherwise nothing is installed.
  * Every file is checked against the SHA-256 in the bundle's manifest before anything is put in place. A damaged, missing or extra file stops the install.
  * The bundle's lock file becomes yours. A different lock file already there is kept as `packages.lock.eld.before-bundle`.
  * The `sync` that follows refuses the network: url.el fetches and git's network transports fail. Anything the bundle lacks stops the install with its name, instead of being downloaded.

---

### `bundle`
```sh
bin/hellmacs bundle OUT.tar.zst [--modules SPEC]
```
Run on a connected machine. It syncs, then packs everything the sync installed into one archive, for machines without internet:
* Elpaca's repositories, builds and recipe caches.
* Every pinned language server and jar (JDTLS with java-debug and the JUnit runner, Lombok, kotlin-language-server, clojure-lsp) and the tree-sitter grammars.
* A lock file with the exact commit of every package, and a manifest with the SHA-256 of every file.

Details:
* Compression follows the file name: `.tar.zst` (needs `zstd`), `.tar.gz`, `.tar.xz`, or `.tar`.
* It prints the bundle's own SHA-256, so you can publish it next to the bundle. The manifest's sums catch a damaged or altered file, but they travel inside the bundle, so get the bundle itself from a place you trust.
* A bundle is for one platform (grammars and clojure-lsp are native code) and one Emacs major version (packages are byte-compiled). Make one per platform your team uses.
* It carries what your enabled modules install. `--modules` packs another set, written like a `hellmacs!` block: `--modules ":lang (java +lombok) kotlin :tools lsp build"`. That also syncs this machine for those modules, so run it under its own profile (`bin/hellmacs --profile bundle bundle ...`) to leave yours alone.
* A server you use from your `PATH` (clojure-lsp, for example) isn't installed by sync, so the bundle doesn't carry it either. The installing machine then needs it on its `PATH` too.

Then, on the offline machine: `bin/hellmacs install --from-bundle hellmacs.tar.zst`.

---

### `sync`
```sh
bin/hellmacs sync
```
* Analyzes all active modules declared in your `init.el` and `packages.el`.
* Uses Elpaca to fetch missing packages and compile Tree-sitter grammars.
* Rewrites the static load profile (`profile.eld`) for sub-second startup times: every package's autoloads merged into one compiled file, and core plus each enabled module's `config.el` byte-compiled into the profile's `compiled/` directory. Startup uses the compiled files only while they match their sources; edit a file and it loads from source until the next `sync`.

---

### `upgrade`
```sh
bin/hellmacs upgrade [--packages]
```
* Pulls the latest commits from the Hellmacs git repository.
* Updates all installed packages that do not have a fixed `:pin`.
* Runs `sync` to generate a fresh profile.
* With `--packages`, upgrades only installed packages without running `git pull` on Hellmacs itself.

---

### `lock`
```sh
bin/hellmacs lock
```
* Generates a lockfile (`~/.config/hellmacs/packages.lock.eld`) pinning the exact Git commit SHA of every installed package.
* Commit this lockfile into your dotfiles repo to achieve 100% reproducible environments across team laptops and CI.

---

### `doctor`
```sh
bin/hellmacs doctor [--network]
```
Runs a health check on your system, reporting:
* Emacs version and native-compilation status.
* External CLI tools (`git`, `rg`, `fd`, `mvn`, `gradle`, `unzip`, JDKs).
* The network: the proxy, CA bundle and mirrors in use, the JVM truststore, and whether each host Hellmacs fetches from (package sources, language-server downloads) can be reached through them. A host whose certificate isn't trusted is reported as a CA missing from `hellmacs-ca-bundle`. Hosts are checked whenever a proxy, CA or mirror is set, and otherwise only with `--network`.
* The Maven `settings.xml` and Gradle home JDTLS imports with (`:lang java`).
* Module-specific assets (fonts, icons, language server binaries).
* Configuration and profile validity.

---

### `env`
```sh
bin/hellmacs env [--clear]
```
* Captures your current shell environment (`PATH`, `JAVA_HOME`, proxy settings, etc.) into `~/.local/share/hellmacs/env.eld`.
* Allows Emacs launched from GUI desktop launchers (which lack full shell environment) to discover all system tools.
* `--clear` removes the saved environment file.

---

### `gc`
```sh
bin/hellmacs gc [-n]
```
* Removes old and orphaned package installations that are no longer referenced by any enabled module.
* Use `-n` for a dry run.

---

### `test`
```sh
bin/hellmacs test [SELECTOR]
```
* Executes the internal ERT unit test suite.

---

## Multi-Profile Flag (`--profile`)

Every command accepts `--profile <NAME>` as its first argument:

```sh
bin/hellmacs --profile work sync
bin/hellmacs --profile work doctor
bin/hellmacs --profile work upgrade
```
