# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Hellmacs is an Emacs distribution (Emacs 29.1+, pure Emacs Lisp with `lexical-binding: t`) aimed at JVM development (Java, Kotlin, Clojure). Its module system is modeled on Doom Emacs (`hellmacs!`, `modulep!`, `package!`), but it keeps stock GNU Emacs keybindings. Elpaca is the package manager.

## Commands

All commands go through `bin/hellmacs`, a thin sh wrapper that runs `emacs --batch` with `early-init.el` and dispatches to `hellmacs-cli-main` in `core/hellmacs-cli.el`. Set `$EMACS` to use a different Emacs binary.

```sh
bin/hellmacs test                 # run all ERT unit tests (test/test-*.el)
bin/hellmacs test 'test-java/'    # run only the tests whose names match this regexp
bin/hellmacs test 'test-build/commands'   # a single test
bin/hellmacs doctor               # health checks (core + every enabled module's doctor.el)
bin/hellmacs sync                 # install packages, build tree-sitter grammars, rewrite profile
bin/hellmacs --profile dev sync   # --profile NAME must come first
emacs --init-directory .          # run this checkout interactively
```

- The argument to `test` is an ERT selector **regexp matched against test names**, not file names. Tests are named `test-<file>/<case>`.
- `bin/hellmacs test` points every `XDG_*_HOME` and `HELLMACSDIR` at a throwaway temp dir, so unit tests never touch the real config and don't need a synced profile.
- The integration scripts in `test/integration/` (`*-e2e.el`, `*-parity.el`, `startup-bench.el`) are **not** run by `bin/hellmacs test`. They need a synced profile with the relevant modules enabled, real language servers/JDKs, and sometimes network access. Each file's header gives its exact invocation, e.g.:
  ```sh
  HELLMACS_E2E_FIXTURE=maven-demo emacs --batch -l early-init.el -l init.el -l test/integration/java-e2e.el
  ```
  Fixture projects live in `test/fixtures/`.

The project rules (`docs/development/ai/context-primer.md`) require running `bin/hellmacs test` and `bin/hellmacs doctor` after any change to the core engine or to modules.

## Architecture

### Boot sequence
- `early-init.el`: GC tuning, XDG directory remapping (defines `hellmacs-dir`, `hellmacs-core-dir`, and the data/cache/state dirs), and suppression of UI chrome. `bin/hellmacs` also loads it.
- `init.el`: only orchestrates, with no configuration of its own. The header comment documents the fixed load order: `core/hellmacs-lib.el` (macros like `after!` and `add-hook!`) → `hellmacs-core` → `hellmacs-packages` → `hellmacs-keybinds` (the `C-c` leader, `hellmacs-leader-def`) → `hellmacs-modules` → splash/ux/treesit → user `init.el` (the `hellmacs!` block) → package activation → each module's `autoload.el` + `init.el` → each module's `config.el` → user `config.el` → `custom-file`.
- Package activation reads a static **profile** written by `bin/hellmacs sync`. If the profile is missing or stale, startup reads every `packages.el` and falls back to a live Elpaca install (`core/hellmacs-sync.el`, `core/hellmacs-elpaca.el`).

### Modules (`core/hellmacs-modules.el`)
A module is `modules/<group>/<name>/`, written `:group name`. Every file in it is optional:
- `packages.el`: declarations only, read at sync time (and by `doctor`); the synced profile keeps what startup needs from them. That means `(package! ...)`, `(depends-on! :tools lsp)` for modules this one needs, and `(hellmacs-treesit! :grammars ... :remap ...)` under `+tree-sitter` for pinned grammars and mode remaps. Don't hand-write "needs module X" warnings or tree-sitter remap/doctor code in other files.
- `autoload.el`: commands and helpers that other files may call.
- `init.el`: runs before any module's `config.el`.
- `config.el`: the actual configuration, usually `use-package` forms.
- `cli.el`: extends `bin/hellmacs`, for example by adding to `hellmacs-sync-functions` or adding commands.
- `doctor.el`: checks run by `bin/hellmacs doctor`.
- `+paths.el` (lang modules): language-server and workspace locations. Both `config.el` and `cli.el` load it, so batch and interactive sessions agree on paths.

User modules in `$HELLMACS_USER_DIR/modules/` fully override core modules with the same name. The user directory is resolved in this order: `$HELLMACSDIR` → `~/.config/hellmacs/` → `~/.hellmacs.d/`. Use `(modulep! +flag)` and `(modulep! :group name +flag)` to gate code on module flags. When there is no user `init.el`, the default module set comes from `static/init.example.el`. That makes it the single source of defaults: register new modules there.

Some larger UI implementations live next to their module directories rather than inside them, and the module's `config.el` requires them. Examples are `modules/ui/hellmacs-modeline.el` and `modules/ui/hellmacs-dashboard.el`. New modules start from `static/module-template/`.

## Project rules

- **Stock Emacs keybindings only.** Never add Evil/modal bindings or single-key hijacks. Hellmacs bindings go under `C-c`, mainly the `C-c h` leader via `hellmacs-leader-def`. Leave built-in help (`C-h …`) untouched.
- **XDG isolation.** Never hardcode `~/.emacs.d` or write state to `$HOME`. Use `hellmacs-data-dir`, `hellmacs-cache-dir`, `hellmacs-state-file`, and related helpers.
- **Packages** are declared only with `package!` in a `packages.el`. Never call `package-install` or `straight-use-package`.
- **Built-ins first.** Prefer `project.el`, `treesit`, `compile`, and similar built-ins. Add a third-party package only when it's needed.
- **Startup budget is under 0.12s.** Keep work lazy (autoloads, `after!`, hooks). `test/integration/startup-bench.el` measures startup time.
- Java is the reference language target; Kotlin and Clojure modules follow its patterns (`+paths.el`, `cli.el`, `doctor.el`).
- Every source file carries the GPL-3.0-or-later header with the `petrolal` copyright. Preserve it and add it to new files.

## Docs

`docs/development/ai/` has machine-oriented specs: architecture, module contracts, and JVM integration contracts. `docs/roadmap.md` tracks phases; code comments often refer to them ("Phase 6.2", "Phase 9 spec"). Some docs describe planned features, so check the code before relying on them.
